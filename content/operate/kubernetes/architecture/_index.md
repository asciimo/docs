Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes gives you the speed and durability of [Redis Enterprise](https://redis.io/redis-enterprise/advantages/), with the flexibility and ease of use Kubernetes (K8s) provides. Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes uses a custom operator and custom controllers to bring the best of Redis Enterprise to Kubernetes platforms.

The image below illustrates the components of a single namespace, three node deployment.

## Operator

An operator is a custom extension of the Kubernetes API designed to manage complex, stateful processes and resources. The Redis Enterprise operator uses controllers to manage Redis Enterpriseâ€™s custom resources (CRs), ensuring that these resources are continuously monitored and maintained.

## Namespace

The Redis Enterprise operator is deployed within a namespace. Each namespace can host only one operator and one RedisEnterpriseCluster instance. Namespaces create a logical boundaries between resources, allowing organization and security. Some resources in your deployment are limited to a namespace, while others are cluster-wide.

Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes supports multi-namespace deployments, meaning databases in multiple namespaces can be monitored by a single operator.

## Custom resources

Custom resources (CRs) extend the Kubernetes API, enabling users to manage Redis databases the Kubernetes way. Custom resources are created and managed using YAML configuration files.

This [declarative configuration approach](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/declarative-config/) allows you to specify the desired state for your resources, and the operator makes the necessary changes to achieve that state. This simplifies installation, upgrades, and scaling both vertically and horizontally.

The operator continuously monitors CRs for changes, automatically reconciling any differences between the desired state you specified in your YAML configuration file and the actual state of your resources.

## Custom resource definitions

A custom resource definition (CRD) is a cluster-wide resource that specifies which settings can be configured via custom resource files. Any setting not defined by the CRD is not managed by the operator. Changes to these unmanaged settings can still be made using standard Redis Enterprise Software methods.

For settings managed by the operator, any changes made outside of the CR YAML files (e.g., through the management UI) will be overwritten by the operator. Ensure that all operator-managed settings are updated using the CR YAML files to prevent conflicts.
